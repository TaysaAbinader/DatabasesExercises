Question 1. Vesa flies from his current location to the Nottingham Airport. At the same time, Vesa's carbon footprint increases by 500. Update the information to the database.

Hint 1: You need to use a subquery to find out the ident value of Nottingham Airport.
Answer:
MariaDB [airport]> update game set game.location = (select ident from airport where airport.name = "Nottingham Airport") where game.screen_name = "Vesa";
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.057 sec)
Rows matched: 1  Changed: 1  Warnings: 0

MariaDB [airport]> select * from game;
+----+--------------+------------+----------+-------------+
| id | co2_consumed | co2_budget | location | screen_name |
+----+--------------+------------+----------+-------------+
| 1  |         2000 |      10000 | EFHK     | Heini       |
| 2  |         3000 |      10000 | EGBN     | Vesa        |
| 3  |         8000 |      10000 | EGKK     | Ilkka       |
+----+--------------+------------+----------+-------------+

MariaDB [airport]> update game set co2_consumed = 3500 where game.screen_name = "Vesa";
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.002 sec)
Rows matched: 1  Changed: 1  Warnings: 0

MariaDB [airport]> select * from game;
+----+--------------+------------+----------+-------------+
| id | co2_consumed | co2_budget | location | screen_name |
+----+--------------+------------+----------+-------------+
| 1  |         2000 |      10000 | EFHK     | Heini       |
| 2  |         3500 |      10000 | EGBN     | Vesa        |
| 3  |         8000 |      10000 | EGKK     | Ilkka       |

Question 2. Prepare your own database for the project by deleting all dummy data relating to the game state. To maintain referential integrity, you have to delete the data in a specific order.

Do you have to delete data first from the game table or from the goal_reached table?

a. game

b. goal_reached
Answer: B (goal reached) because that's the table that connects data from games table to goal table.

Question 3. Delete the dummy data from the goal_reached table.
Answer:
MariaDB [airport]> delete from goal_reached;
Query OK, 4 rows affected (0.002 sec)

MariaDB [airport]> select * from goal_reached;
Empty set (0.000 sec)

Question 4. Delete the data from the game table.
Answer:
MariaDB [airport]> delete from game;
Query OK, 3 rows affected (0.002 sec)

MariaDB [airport]> select * from game;
Empty set (0.001 sec)
